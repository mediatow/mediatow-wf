The Custom Facebook Feed allows you to display a completely customizable Facebook feed of any public Facebook page on your website.

* Show **events** from your Facebook feed with name, date/time, location and description
* Add your own **custom CSS**
* Show and hide certain parts of each post
* Choose to show the Facebook profile picture and name above each post
* Select whether to display posts by just the page owner, or everyone who posts on your Facebook page
* Control the width, height, padding and background color of your Facebook feed
* Customize the size, weight and color of text
* Select from a range of date formats or enter your own
* Use your own custom link text in place of the defaults
* Use the shortcode options to style multiple Facebook feeds in completely different ways

Try out the [Pro demo](http://smashballoon.com/custom-facebook-feed/demo "Custom Facebook Feed Demo").

== Installation ==

1. Install the Custom Facebook Feed either via the WordPress plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your web server (in the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory).
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Navigate to the 'Facebook Feed' settings page to configure your feed.
4. Use the shortcode `[custom-facebook-feed]` in your page, post or widget to display your feed.
5. You can display multiple feeds of different Facebook pages by specifying a Page ID directly in the shortcode: `[custom-facebook-feed id=smashballoon num=5]`.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I find the Page ID of my Facebook page? =

If you have a Facebook page with a URL like this: `https://www.facebook.com/Your_Page_Name` then the Page ID is just `Your_Page_Name`.  If your Facebook page URL is structured like this: `https://www.facebook.com/pages/Your_Page_Name/123654123654123` then the Page ID is actually the number at the end, so in this case `123654123654123`.

= Are there any limitations on which Facebook page feeds I can display? =

The Facebook feed you're trying to display has to be from a publicly accessible Facebook page. This means that you can't display the feed from your own personal Facebook profile or Facebook group. This is to do with Facebook's privacy policies. You can't display a non-public Facebook feed publicly.

If your Facebook page has any restrictions on it (age, for example) then it means that people have to be signed into Facebook in order to view your page. This isn't desirable for most Facebook pages as it means that it isn't accessible by people who don't have a Facebook account and that your Facebook page can't be crawled and indexed by search engines.

An easy way to determine whether your Facebook page is set to public is to sign out of your Facebook account and try to visit your page. If Facebook forces you to sign in to view your page then it isn't public. You can change your Facebook page to public in your Facebook page settings simply by removing any restrictions you have on it, which will then allow the Custom Facebook Feed plugin to access and display your feed.

= What's an Access Token and why do I need one? =

An Access Token is required by Facebook in order to access their feeds.  Don't worry, it's easy to get one.  Just follow the step-by-step instructions [here](http://smashballoon.com/custom-facebook-feed/access-token/ "Getting an Access Token"). to get yours. Your Access Token will never expire.

= Can I display feeds from multiple Facebook pages? =

Yep. You set your default Facebook page ID in the plugin's settings but then you can define different Facebook page IDs in the shortcodes you use to show multiple feeds from different Facebook pages. Just use the id option in your shortcode like so: id=another_page_id.

= Can I show photos and videos in my Custom Facebook feed? =

This free plugin only allows you to display textual updates from your Facebook feed. To display photos and videos in your feed you need to upgrade to the PRO version of the plugin. Try out a demo of the PRO version on the [Custom Facebook Feed website](http://smashballoon.com/custom-facebook-feed/demo "Custom Facebook Feed Demo"), and find out more about the PRO version [here](http://smashballoon.com/custom-facebook-feed/ "Custom Facebook Feed PRO").

= Can I show the comments associated with each Facebook post? =

For this feature please upgrade to the [PRO version of the plugin](http://smashballoon.com/custom-facebook-feed/ "Custom Facebook Feed PRO").

= Is the content of my feed crawlable by search engines? =

It sure is. Unlike other Facebook plugins which use iframes to embed your feed into your page once it's loaded, the Custom Facebook Feed uses PHP to embed your Facebook feed content directly into your page. This adds dynamic, search engine crawlable content to your site.

= How do I embed the feed directly into a WordPress page template? =

You can embed the feed directly into a template file by using the WordPress do_shortcode function: do_shortcode('[custom-facebook-feed]'');
